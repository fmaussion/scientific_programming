    "[Object-oriented programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) (OOP) is a standard feature of many modern programming languages. Learning OOP \"properly\" would require one entire semester at least, and we won't try to cover all the details here. The specific objectives of these three OOP units are:\n",
    "- to learn the basic OOP concepts and syntax so that you are able to understand OOP code and can use libraries making use of OOP concepts (i.e.: almost all python libraries)\n",
    "- to become familiar with certain semantics associated with OOP: classes, objects, attributes, methods, inheritance\n",
    "- to introduce simple examples where OOP is a useful paradigm, and try to raise your interest in its usage so that you can learn it by yourself when needed\n",
    "\n",
    "Today's OOP unit introduces the concept of \"objects\" in the Python language and shows how to create new kind of objects on your own. Next week we will learn the concept of class inheritance. Finally, we will learn in which circumstances objects can be useful, and when not."

    "As stated in the [OOP wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming), OOP is a \"paradigm\" which might or might not be supported by a specific programming language. Although Python is an OOP language at its core, **it does not enforce its usage**. Matlab or R follow the same philosophy: they support OOP but do not force their users to use it. In fact, many of you will finish your master thesis without having to write any OOP specific code. You have, however, already made heavy use of Python objects (*everything* is an object in Python, remember?) and I argue that it is very important that you are able to understand the basics of OOP in order to make better use of Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, **OOP is simply another way to structure your programs**. Until now, you have written modules consisting of functions, sometimes with a short ``__main__`` script which was itself calling one or more functions. OOP will add a new tool to your repertoire by allowing you to **bundle data and behaviors into individual objects**, possibly helping you to organize your code in a way that feels more natural and clear.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get started with some examples and new semantics! We will talk about the advantages and disadvantages of OOP in a following unit, once you are more familiar with its syntax."
