    "Use linux on MyBinder for this exercise. Write a python script called ``my_cli_test.py``. The script can be as simple as you wish, but it should produce one printed output (a simple \"Hello world!\" would suffice!). Put this script in a new directory in your ``HOME``, called ``bin``. Using your knowledge from the Linux tutorial, make this script callable from everywhere (not just from the ``bin`` directory) with a call to ``$ my_cli_test.py``. If not on MyBinder, make this change \"permanent\" for your ``HOME`` environment (on MyBinder it is possible to do it as well, but it will be forgotten next time you open a session anyway)."
