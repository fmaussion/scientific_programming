On line 3 we used the ``print()`` function to display the output of our computations, but as it turns out it is not necessary: the command line shell will print the output anyway. This functionality is called [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop), and it is a feature of modern interpreted languages. We'll come back to this later.\n",

Some important functionalities are missing: some are cosmetic (like colors), some are very useful (like **automatic code completion** with ``[TAB]`` or the possibility to paste several lines of code at once). For all these reasons, the default python command-line interpreter is only used for very small tasks like testing a command or two. Scientists need more interactivity when analyzing their data: this is why ``ipython`` was created."
