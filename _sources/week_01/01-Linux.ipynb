Atmospheric Sciences students in particular will have to use it sooner or later, since most of the tools and data they are using are running or have been created on Linux systems."

    "My very personal answer is a clear: **yes**! I can't force you to it though, and all of the exercises of this lecture can be done on a Windows computer. If you are running Mac OS X then you have access to a linux terminal anyway and you can ignore my recommendation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Linux has always been an environment for programmers and has the reputation of being \"geeky\" and \"overly complicated\". This is less true today, with many Linux distributions becoming mainstream and easy to use (my personal favorite is [Linux Mint](http://linuxmint.com), but you probably heard of [Ubuntu](http://ubuntugnome.org/), which I also recommend).  \n",
    "\n",
    "I believe that Linux is more user-friendly than Windows: once some of the particularities of Linux are understood (which can be frustrating in the beginning since it works *very* differently than windows), it appears that there is much less \"hidden\" in Linux than in Windows (especially when it comes to installing/deinstalling software, using the command line, or protecting yourself from viruses and intruders).\n",
    "\n",
    "**As a scientist and programmer** there are many reasons to prefer Linux (or Mac OS X) to Windows. Let me list some reasons here:\n",
    "- **Linux comes with many tools for scientists and programmers** (\"batteries included\"). For historical reasons, Linux and its command line tools have been used by scientists and programmers since decades. It is not a surprise then that Linux comes with many (many) useful utilities to make programming and working with data easier.\n",
    "- **Linux is fast and reliable**. Linux is extremely stable and more lightweight than Windows. I've never seen a Linux machine becoming *slower* with time, as I was used to see in my time using Windows (I have to admit: it was more than 10 years ago).\n",
    "- **Linux is the operating system of the vast majority of the super computers and web servers worldwide**. Because of its efficiency, security, and multiple user management tools, Linux has taken over the web: [99.4%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_adoption#Supercomputers) of the super computers and [67.5%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_adoption#Servers) of the web servers run Linux, while [79.3%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_adoption#Mobile_devices) of the mobile devices run Linux via Android.\n",
    "- **Linux is at the heart of the open-source philosophy**. Linux is free and open-source, and it is not surprising that people who embraced the open-source philosophy also prefer Linux to Windows or Mac.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also some reasons **not** to use Linux of course. For one, Linux can be confusing at first and you'll need some time to get used to it. Also, it doesn't come pre-installed on most computers and you'll have to do it yourself (however, several retailers are already selling cheaper Ubuntu laptops to students). It is possible (but unlikely) that some of your hardware will not be compatible with Linux. Finally, some programs simply aren't available on Linux: Microsoft Office, the Adobe Suite, and computer games are the most prominent examples. The free and open-source alternatives (LibreOffice and GIMP) are good, but not *as* good as their commercial counterpart. I used Linux exclusively for more than 10 years now, and I never regretted it. Recently I had to install Windows in a virtual machine in order to use the MS Office software provided by the University, and it works perfectly. Another option is to use [wine](https://www.winehq.org/)."

    "- **At the University of Innsbruck**: In order to use Linux in the computer room you have to register for an account [here](http://orawww.uibk.ac.at/public_prod/owa/uvw$web$10.p001). After an hour or so you will be able to connect to any computer using your username and password. The Linux distribution used at the university is [CentOS](https://www.centos.org/) (not my favorite, unfortunately). If you are a student of another university, it is likely that you have access to Linux environments, too.\n",
    "- **On your laptop with Windows 10, with [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)**: if you want to stay on Windows while still enjoying the powerful Linux command line. It can be a bit confusing (this is *Linux* working *within* Windows) - for a feel of the linux command line without much hassle you might as well install and run ``git bash`` (see below).\n",
    "- **On your laptop, with a live USB**: this is the [best way to try it at no risk](https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/tutorial/try-ubuntu-before-you-install) and get a feeling for the general usage of a linux distribution. This is not permanent though.  \n",
    "- **On your laptop, in a virtual machine**: This is a relatively easy and non-destructive way to try Linux. There are tons of tutorials online, [this one](https://helpdeskgeek.com/linux-tips/how-to-install-ubuntu-in-virtualbox/) seems OK. The problem with virtual machines is that they need a lot of resources (about double) to run both OS at the same time.\n",
    "- **On your laptop, alongside Windows (dual boot)**: this is a bit more engaged, but the best way if you want to use both operating systems at full capacity. See [here](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsDualBoot) for the official instructions. Be careful however: it is possible that things get a bit complicated going this way: secure your data first, and be prepared for some unexpected events. \n",
    "- **On your laptop, without Windows**: Congratulations, this is the best solution! Please check that your hardware is [compatible](https://certification.ubuntu.com/desktop/) first, and follow the install instructions of your chosen OS. If you want to use Windows afterwards you can still re-install it or install it in a virtual machine. "
