    "If you did some online search about Python, you probably stumbled upon some discussion about the \"Py2 vs Py3 problem\". About 10 years ago, an evolution of the python language introduced changes which were not **backwards compatible**. This means that code written in Python 2.7 may not work in Python 3. According to the Python developers this change was necessary to get rid of old baggage and inconsistent syntax, but it was also considered by many as a \"treason\". Indeed, backwards compatibility is an important aspect of software development for large projects like python: it is a contract between developers and users stipulating that the code that users write will continue to work in subsequent releases. This contract was broken once, but this shouldn't happen again. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since updating code requires time and money, many people and companies continued to use Python 2 internally. Five years ago, I would maybe have been reluctant to teach you Python 3 because the future of the language was uncertain and many tools existed only in Python 2. Today the wide adoption of Python 3 is finally accomplished and the future is looking very good. All major scientific python tools are supporting Python 3, and major libraries [announced that they will stop to support Python 2](http://python3statement.org/) before or shortly after the end-of-life date of Python 2 (by 2020).\n",
    "\n",

    "- python is available per default on almost all linux distributions, for the simple reason that many software packages use python internally \n",
    "- it is not available per default on windows, but it can be installed \n",
    "- the system python is useful for scripting or for simple tasks, but for real-world applications you want to install python (and related packages) on your own. \n",
    "- the best tool to install a custom python and selected packages is [conda](https://conda.io/docs/), installed via [miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html)\n",
    "- **conda-forge** and **mamba** are drop-in replacements for the default anaconda channels and conda install commands, respectively. They are useful for more advanced use cases\n",
    "- on linux, a python \"installation\" is simply a link to a python executable file - on Windows, it's more complicated\n",
    "- Windows excels at hiding details to the users: this can be good sometimes (for example when you want to play games or run microsoft word), but as a scientist I recommend you start to think and learn about how things work on the system you use everyday. In short: stick to Windows if you like it, but **learn how to use it properly** and learn **how it works from the inside**."
