It is widely used to indicate that if you choose python, it's not only for its syntax: it's for all the tools that come with it. And there are PLENTY. Spend a minute or two to scroll through the list of tools available in the [standard library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html). The **standard library** is available per default with any python installation. It is very robust and provides the core functionality of the language.\n",

And there are so many of them that one can easily be overwhelmed: for this week's assignment we will continue to use the standard library only, but starting next week we will use external packages as well."

In recent years, the Stack Exchange community of sites has emerged as a major resource for answering technical and other questions and is even the preferred forum for many open-source projects.

When you encounter a problem, ask yourself the following question: **is it likely that someone else had this problem before me?** In a large majority of the cases, the answer will be \"yes\" (believe me on this one).

The advantages of IDEs is that they ship with tools that make your life easier when programming. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a non-exhaustive (and subjective) list of the tools a good IDE should have:\n",
    "- <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)\">linter</a>: automatic detection of syntax errors and style violations\n",
    "- [debugger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debugger): helping you find where the errors in your program come from\n",
    "- [intelligent code completion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_code_completion): automatic `TAB` completion, module recognition, etc.\n",
    "- project explorer and code exploration tools\n",
    "- for interactive languages: a command line and variable explorer\n",
    "- appealing colors and graphics\n",
    "- ...\n",

    "- [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org): the IDE made by and for scientists. It resembles the Matlab IDE and has many nice features such as variable exploration and an integrated ipython console. It is very easy to install with conda, and is therefore available on linux at the university (``$ spyder &``). **It is my recommended IDE for this semester's course**.\n",
    "- [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/): this is my current personal favorite. It is however quite heavyweight and can be confusing for beginners. The community version of PyCharm is free, and has enough functionality for most use cases.\n",
    "- [Atom](https://atom.io/): a modern, very nice looking editor. Useful if you program in more than one language, but you must install additional packages to transform it in a real IDE.\n",
    "- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (from Microsoft) is one of the newest \"cool kids\" around. I have not tested it myself, but people seem to be very happy with it. Like Atom, you'll have to install plugins for it to become a true python IDE.\n",
    "- [vim](https://www.vim.org/) or [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/): for people allergic to the mouse. Not recommended for most of us, but the people who learned to use them are (allegedly) the fastest programmers ever."
