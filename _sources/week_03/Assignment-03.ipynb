    "[SRTM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuttle_Radar_Topography_Mission) is a digital elevation model (DEM) at ~90 m resolution covering almost the entire globe (up to $\\pm$ 60° latitude). The data is organized in 5°x5° tiles. To see a map of the tiles have a look at [this download page](http://srtm.csi.cgiar.org/srtmdata/). This tool is nice to use if you know which tile you want, but not very useful if you want more than one tile at different places of the globe.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, the entire dataset is available on this server: `srtm.csi.cgiar.org/wp-content/uploads/files/srtm_5x5/TIFF/`\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to protect from disruptive \"download all\" behavior, the files stored here cannot be listed (i.e. automated data scraping won't work). Fortunately for us, the file naming convention is very simple:\n",
    "- example file: [http://srtm.csi.cgiar.org/wp-content/uploads/files/srtm_5x5/TIFF/srtm_39_04.zip](http://srtm.csi.cgiar.org/wp-content/uploads/files/srtm_5x5/TIFF/srtm_39_04.zip)\n",
    "- the first two digits give the location of the tile in the longitudes (starting at 180° West)\n",
    "- the last two digits give the location of the tile in the latitudes (starting at 60° North and going southwards)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some examples of locations and their associated tile:\n",
    "- (-179, 59) -> 'srtm_01_01.zip'\n",
    "- (-179, 51) -> 'srtm_01_02.zip'\n",
    "- (-174, 54) -> 'srtm_02_02.zip'\n",
    "- (-180, 60) -> 'srtm_01_01.zip' (upper-left corner case)\n",
    "\n",
    "And so forth.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A. Write a script which, given a longitude and a latitude as arguments, downloads the corresponding file** in the current directory. The tool should print an error message when the given location is not valid and exit the script. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Hint A1: define \"valid\" locations first: some are easy to catch, some cannot be caught automatically. Do we really have to deal with those?*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Hint A2: unlike last week where we asked for user input, here I'm asking for a script with [command line arguments](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/stdlib.html?highlight=sys%20argv#command-line-arguments). The command `%run download_srtm.py 9 44` (in an ipython interpreter) should download the file at the location 9°W, 44°N.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Hint A3: although I agree with the python documentation that `argparse` is more robust (and much better) than parsing `sys.argv` yourself, for the purpose of learning I would like you to use `sys.argv` today and handle the command line arguments yourselves.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**B.** Extend this script to be a bit more clever: **download the data file only if the file isn't already available in the current directory**. This is particularly useful because the server is not very fast. \n",
    "\n",
    "**C.** Extend this script to be even more clever: **given a range of longitudes and latitudes, it should download all the files covering this area**. For example, the range 9°W to 18°W and 44°N to 47°N would download 6 files. **In order to avoid manual mistakes, warn the user by announcing the number of files that the command is going to download, and ask for confirmation before going on** (by using the `input()` function).\n",
    "\n",
    "*Hint C1: the command should now be `%run download_srtm.py 9 44 18 47`.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**D.** Let's add even more functionality to our script:\n",
    "\n",
    "**D1.** **print a message to the user announcing if the file was downloaded or was already on disk**\n",
    "\n",
    "**D2.** **print the size of the file after download** - choose [an appropriate unit](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UnitsPolicy) for the text\n",
    "\n",
    "**D3.** let's assume that the user actually wants to download the files in a specific folder instead of the current directory (i.e. a folder where she stores all her DEMs). Let's give this opportunity to her by adding two options to the script:\n",
    "- `--output-dir /path/to/a/dir` should **write the file (and check for its existence) in the directory given as argument**\n",
    "- if the target directory does not exist, print a message to the screen indicating that you can't continue and exit the script\n",
    "\n",
    "**D4.** (optional: see the warning about windows below) **if the user asks for a plot, write a plot to disk** (alongside the DEM file) with the file name `srtm_39_04.png` (if the tile 39, 4 was asked for). The user may ask for a plot by adding a `--plot` to the list of arguments. I.e. `%run download_srtm.py 9 44 18 47 --plot` would write 6 plots in the user-chosen default directory. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a template for your plotting function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "import xarray as xr\n",
    "\n",
    "# This is some real magic: we open the file from within the zip\n",
    "f = 'zip://srtm_39_04.zip!srtm_39_04.tif'\n",
    "\n",
    "# Read the data and plot\n",
    "with xr.open_rasterio(f) as da:\n",
    "    da.sel(band=1).plot.imshow(cmap='terrain', vmin=0)\n",
    "    plt.ylabel('Lat (°)'); plt.xlabel('Lon (°)'); plt.title('srtm_39_04'); \n",
    "plt.savefig('srtm_39_04.png')\n",
    "plt.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "No need to add more features to the plot than that: we haven't talked about these libraries yet! Just make sure that the filename is set to the correct value.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{tip}\n",
    "You'll need the matplotlib, xarray and rasterio libraries installed for this to work. Careful! I'm not sure this will work on Windows because of the rasterio package, which has caused trouble in the past. On your laptop, install xarray and matplotlib first: `conda install matplotlib xarray` (this should be pretty safe and is needed for climate anyway). Then follow the [instructions to clone your environment](conda-clone) before trying to install rasterio with `conda install rasterio`.\n",
