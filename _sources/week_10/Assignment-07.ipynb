    "[Pydemic](https://github.com/fmaussion/pydemic) is a simple [agent-based model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent-based_model) of a pandemic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Agents are perfect to teach the basics of object-oriented programming. Note that I wrote the program with this goal in mind, *not* for performance or accuracy. I also just wrote the program in a few hours, so there is room for improvement. You are welcome to help me out!\n",
    "\n",
    "Start by getting an overview of the model structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sensitivity analyses**: starting from the default parameter values, vary one parameter at a time and study the consequences for the temporal trajectory of the pandemic. Of particular relevance are the following: (i) agent density (number of agents per pixel), (ii) initial number of infected agents (is it possible to start a pandemic with a single infected individual? What are the settings that favor this?), (iii) agent mobility, (iv) probability of infection, (v) time until recover.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Add at least one functionality to the model.** Ideas:\n",
    "- add a timer for immunity loss (this can be complexified by computing the probability of infection as a function of time since infection / vaccination)\n",
    "- add vaccination as a way to gain immunity\n",
    "- add a new agent status: hospitalized. When an agent is hospitalized it is out of the domain and may die.\n",
    "- add a healthcare threshold, above which the hospitalized patients are more likely to die.\n",
    "- add politics: when a certain threshold is reached, impose a lockdown.\n",
    "- etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "You don't have to add too many of those (unless you have a lot of fun). Pydemic will keep us busy for the next couple of weeks, so take it easy!"
