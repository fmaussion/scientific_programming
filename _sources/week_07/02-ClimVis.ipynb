    "- Add a small function in ``cfg.py`` which parses this new ``.climvis`` file and uses the given directory in place of the hard-coded one. Tip: you could make good use of [os.path.expanduser](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html#os.path.expanduser) for this function. Optional: you can even write a small command line program (e.g. `cruvis_setup`) which asks the user for the path of the CRU folder, checks if the data is available and if yes, write the file for the user.\n",

    "- you could add a plot of the 1901-2018 timeseries for this grid point, and make a robust trend analysis for the period.\n",
    "- you could add [other data from CRU](https://crudata.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/hrg/cru_ts_4.03/) to the plot.\n",
    "- you could add a new command to the tool called ``uibkvis``, which instead plots the data from the UIBK weather stations. For example, you could plot the temperature for all stations, or even better: give choices to the user as to what they want to plot. You'll have to document its command line options of course. You can get inspiration from the wind statistics we did together, but with more variables.\n",
    "- you could use a python [windrose](https://github.com/python-windrose/windrose) package to plot a windrose from the uibk data, and add the plot to a webpage\n",
    "- you could add an option to ``cruvis``, which accepts a city name instead of the lon and lat of the point. You could use the file shipped with the package for this (`world_cities.csv`: careful - it is quite a badly maintained file - i.e. duplicates and missing cities - and you might want to find another one).\n",
    "- you could add a new command line tool to compare the climate at two locations in one webpage.\n",
    "- you could parse any other data you'd find interesting from the web and plot it! For example, [upper air soundings](http://weather.uwyo.edu/upperair/sounding.html)? \n",
    "- you could use an interactive plotting library like [Bokeh](https://bokeh.pydata.org) (possibly by making use of higher level tools like [holoviews](http://holoviews.org/)) to make reactive plots in your HTML page. For example to visualize the ACINN data interactively?\n",
    "- **any idea you find interesting**! You can discuss some ideas with me beforehand if you are unsure if your idea is not enough or too much. Examples from previous years include:\n",
    "  - a \"fly safe\" info webpage, which scrapped data from the web specifically for flying\n",
    "  - an interactive bokeh app to visualize CRU climate trends in various cities\n",
    "  - an El Ni√±o advisory page\n",
