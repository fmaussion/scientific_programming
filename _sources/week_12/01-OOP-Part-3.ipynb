These objects have a state (in OOP: `attributes`) and realize actions (in OOP: `methods`). For a pen, the states (attributes) could be: `ink_color`, `ink_volume`, `point_size`, etc. The actions (methods) could be: `write()`, `fill_ink()`, etc.\n",

The ``xarray.DataArray`` objects have the task to store``xarray.DataArray``s. This chain of abstractions is possible only if each of these concepts has a clearly defined role: xarray does not mess around with numbers in arrays: numpy does the numerical job behind the scenes.
