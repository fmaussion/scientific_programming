    "This class aims at teaching **modern programming techniques** for (geo-)scientists. After completing the class, attendees will be able to program in a structured, extendable and reproducible manner. They will become familiar with a modern and open-source programming language (Python) and will be able to read and write python programs of medium complexity. They will be able to search for, understand, install and take advantage of existing packages and libraries available in the rich scientific Python ecosystem. They should understand how numbers are handled by computers and be aware of numerical accuracy errors as well as simple performance considerations (vectorization). Furthermore, they will get acquainted with various programming tools (IDEs, debugger, unit testing, open development practices).\n",
    "\n",
    "The targeted audience for this lecture are **students at the master level with previous experience in programming**. No prior knowledge of python is required, but I'll assume that you are familiar with a similar language (Matlab, IDL, R...) and basic programming structures (loops, functions, conditional blocks...). This is *not* an introductory course, although we will shortly revisit programming basics in order to learn the python syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "The course encompasses the following topics, developed by means of concrete examples and practicals:\n",
    "- Introduction to Linux\n",
    "- General programming concepts, differences between compiled and interpreted languages\n",
    "- Revisiting and formalizing basic programming structures (e.g. loops) and learn more advanced ones (e.g. context managers)\n",
    "- Semantics: precise vocabulary in order to ask questions \"the right way\" (see {ref}`getting-help`).\n",
    "- Numerics: floating point numbers, N-dimensional arrays\n",
    "- Software structure: packages, modules, functions, scripts\n",
    "- Object oriented programming: fundamentals, usage, and basic design patterns\n",
    "- Code testing with pytest\n",
    "- Short overview of major scientific python packages\n",
    "- Real world applications!\n",

Read the excellent [Craft Minimal Bug Reports](http://matthewrocklin.com/blog/work/2018/02/28/minimal-bug-reports) article from Matt Rocklin before doing so."
