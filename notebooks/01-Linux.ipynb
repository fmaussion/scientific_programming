    "My very personal answer is a clear: **yes**! I can't force you to it though, and most of the exercises of this lecture can be done on a Windows computer too. If you are running Mac OS X then you have access to a linux terminal anyway and you can ignore my recommendation (even if I don't like Apple for several other reasons - totally subjective opinion again). \n",
    "\n",
    "Linux has always been an environment for programmers and has the reputation of being \"geeky\" and \"complicated\". This is less true today, with many Linux distributions becoming mainstream and easy to use (my personal favorite is [Linux Mint](http://linuxmint.com), but you probably mostly heard of [Ubuntu](http://ubuntugnome.org/) which I also recommend).  \n",
    "\n",
    "I believe that Linux is *much* more user-friendly than Windows: once some of the particularities of Linux are understood (which can be frustrating in the beginning since it works *quite* differently than windows), it appears that there is much less \"hidden\" in Linux than in Windows (especially when it comes to installing/deinstalling software, using the command line, or protecting yourself from viruses and intruders). \n",
    "\n",
    "**As a scientist and programmer** there are many reasons to prefer Linux (or Mac OS X) to Windows. Let me list some reasons here:\n",
    "- **Linux comes with many tools for scientists and programmers** (\"batteries included\"). For historical reasons, Linux and its command line tools have been used by scientists and programmers since decades. It is not a surprise then that Linux comes with many (many) useful utilities to make programming and working with data easier.\n",
    "- **Linux is fast and reliable**. Linux is extremely stable and more lightweight than Windows. I've never seen a Linux machine becoming *slower* with time, as I was used to see in my time using Windows (I have to admit: it was more than 10 years ago).\n",
    "- **Linux is the operating system of the huge majority of the super computers and web servers worldwide**. Because of its efficiency, security, and multiple user management tools, Linux has taken over the web: [99.4%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_adoption#Supercomputers) of the super computers and [67.5%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_adoption#Servers) of the web servers run Linux, while [79.3%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_adoption#Mobile_devices) of the mobile devices run Linux via Android.\n",
    "- **Linux is at the heart of the open-source philosophy**. Linux is free and open-source, and it is not surprising that people who embraced the open-source philosophy also prefer Linux to Windows or Mac. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are also some reasons **not** to use Linux of course. For one, Linux can be surprising at first and you'll need some time to get used to it. Also, it doesn't come pre-installed on most computers and you'll have to do it yourself (this is going to change: several retailers are already selling cheaper Ubuntu laptops to students). It is possible (but unlikely) that some of your hardware will not be compatible with Linux. Finally, some programs simply aren't available on Linux: Microsoft Office, the Adobe Suite, and games are the most prominent examples. The free and open-source alternatives (LibreOffice and GIMP) are good, but not *as* good as their commercial counterpart. I used Linux exclusively for more than 10 years now, and I never regretted it. Recently I had to install Windows in a virtual machine in order to use the MS Office software provided by the University, and it works perfectly. Another option is to use [wine](https://www.winehq.org/)."

    "Here are a few ways you can use Linux and make an idea by yourself:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **At the University of Innsbruck**: In order to use Linux in the computer room you have to register for an account [here](http://orawww.uibk.ac.at/public_prod/owa/uvw$web$10.p001). After an hour or so you will be able to connect to any computer using your username and password. The Linux distribution used at the university is [CentOS](https://www.centos.org/) (not my favorite I have to admit). If you are a student of another university, it is likely that you have access to Linux environments, too.\n",
    "- **On your laptop, with a live CD (or USB)**: this is the [best way to try it at no risk](https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/tutorial/try-ubuntu-before-you-install#0) and get a feeling for the general usage of a linux distribution. This is not permanent though.  \n",
    "- **On your laptop, in a virtual machine**: This is a relatively easy and non-destructive way to try Linux. There are tons of tutorials online, [this one](https://helpdeskgeek.com/linux-tips/how-to-install-ubuntu-in-virtualbox/) seems OK.\n",
    "- **On your laptop, alongside Windows (dual boot)**: this is a bit more engaged, but the best way if you want to use both operating systems at full capacity. See [here](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsDualBoot) for the official instructions. Be careful however: it is possible that things get a bit complicated going this way: secure your data first, and be prepared for some unexpected events. \n",
    "- **On your laptop, without Windows**: Congratulations, this is the best solution! Please check that your hardware is [compatible](https://certification.ubuntu.com/desktop/) first, and follow the install instructions of your chosen OS. If you want to use Windows afterwards you can still re-install it or install it in a virtual machine. "
