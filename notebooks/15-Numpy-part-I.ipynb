It provides more details and a good visual illustration of the ``c = a + b`` example. The second part is a more involved read, but very interesting too!"

    "*As well, it comes down to this: dynamic typing makes Python easier to use than C. It's extremely flexible and forgiving, this flexibility leads to efficient use of development time, and on those occasions that you really need the optimization of C or Fortran, Python offers easy hooks into compiled libraries. It's why Python use within many scientific communities has been continually growing. With all that put together, Python ends up being an extremely efficient language for the overall task of doing science with code.*\n",
