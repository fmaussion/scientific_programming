    "If you did some research about Python you probably stumbled upon some discussion about the Py2 vs Py3 conundrum. About 10 years ago, an evolution of the python language introduced changes which were not **backwards compatible**. This means that code that used to work in Python 2.7 may not work in Python 3. According to the Python developers this change was necessary to get rid of old baggage and inconsistent syntax, but it was also considered by many as a \"treason\". Indeed, backwards compatibility is an important aspect of software development for large projects like python: it is a contract between developers and users stipulating that the code that users write will continue to work in subsequent releases. This contract was broken once, but this shouldn't happen again. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since updating code requires time and money, many people and companies continued to use Python 2 internally. Five years ago, I would maybe have been reluctant to teach you Python 3 because the future of the language was uncertain and many tools existed only in Python 2. Today the wide adoption of Python 3 is finally accomplished and the future is looking good. All major scientific python tools are supporting Python 3, and major libraries [announced that they will stop to support Python 2](http://python3statement.org/) before of shortly after the end-of-life date of Python 2 (by 2020).\n",
